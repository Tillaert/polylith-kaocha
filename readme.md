# polylith-kaocha

Simple [Kaocha](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha )-based test runner implementation for [Polylith](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/).

Created as a demonstration for https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/pull/196, it is very basic and only aims to support `clojure.test` for now.
